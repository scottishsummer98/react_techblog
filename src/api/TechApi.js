      "All new Tesla Model 3 vehicles will now qualify for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, according to a change in Tesla’s website.\r\nThe EV tax credits were mandated by Congress last August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act with the goal of ending U.S. reliance on China for batteries. The full $7,500 tax credit is broken into two parts. EVs can qualify for half, or $3,750, if 50% of the value of battery components were produced or assembled in North America; the other half requires 40% of the value of critical materials be sourced from the U.S. or another free trade agreement country.\r\nNow, it appears that all Tesla vehicles will be eligible for the full $7,500 credit. Previously, the only Model 3 that qualified for the full tax credit was the Model 3 Performance. Now, the Model 3 long-range all-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive will also qualify. The Model 3 rear-wheel drive now starts at $32,740 when the tax credit kicks in.",

      "Last summer, Blackbird, one of Australia’s largest venture operations, marked down the value of one of its most prized stakes, in the Sydney-based design platform Canva. Valued at $40 billion by investors in a $200 million round in the fall of 2021, Blackbird adjusted its own valuation of the company 36% to $25.6 billion.\r\nNow, T. Rowe Price — the mutual fund Goliath that began investing aggressively into late-stage startups nearly a decade ago, continued to fund them throughout the pandemic, and led the $40 billion round in 2021 — has marked down the value of its stake in Canva even more dramatically, adjusting it by a whopping 67.6%. (T. Rowe’s Blue Chip Growth Fund, which owns several classes of Canva shares but predominantly Series A shares, has to date invested $99.1 million in Canva and states in its most recent prospectus, dated March 31, that it now values those shares on a cost-adjusted basis at $32.1 million.) \r\nAsked for comment earlier today, a spokesperson for Canva downplayed the number, writing in an email: “As a profitable company with very healthy cash reserves, we’re in a fortunate position to continue focusing on building an enduring company for the long term. Regardless of the macroeconomic environment, we’re well positioned to continue doubling down on key initiatives, including growing our team and expanding our product and AI innovation efforts.”",

      "A Kenyan court has ruled that Meta is the primary employer of content moderators suing the social media giant and its content review partner in Africa, Sama, for unlawful dismissal. The 184 moderators, in the suit filed in March this year, also alleged that Meta’s new content review partner on the continent, Majorel, had blacklisted them on instruction by Meta. Justice Byram Ongaya of Kenya’s employment and labor relations court on Friday watered down the social media giant’s plan to recuse itself from the case saying the moderators did Meta’s work, used its technology for the work, as well as adhered to its performance and accuracy metrics. The court said that Sama was “merely an agent…or manager.” Sama disputed this, saying “Meta is a client of Sama’s and Sama is not legally empowered to act on behalf of Meta.” Meta told TechCrunch it disagrees with the ruling and will appeal it.\r\nThe latest development is a blow to Meta, which has sought to distance itself from the petition saying that it is not the moderators’ employer.\r\n“The evidence is that the obligation to provide the digital work of content moderation belong to the first and second respondents who provided the digital or virtual workspace for the applicants. The first and second respondents exercise control by imposing the operational requirements and standards of performance. The first and second respondent then provided the remuneration back through the agent [Sama],” the court said.",

      "AI researchers have built a Minecraft bot that can explore and expand its capabilities in the game’s open world — but unlike other bots, this one basically wrote its own code through trial and error and lots of GPT-4 queries.\r\nCalled Voyager, this experimental system is an example of an “embodied agent,” an AI that can move and act freely and purposefully in a simulated or real environment. Personal assistant type AIs and chatbots don’t have to actually do stuff, let alone navigate a complex world to get that stuff done. But that’s exactly what a household robot might be expected to do in the future, so there’s lots of research into how they might do that.\r\nMinecraft is a good place to test such things because it’s a very (very) approximate representation of the real world, with simple and straightforward rules and physics, but it’s also complex and open enough that there’s lots to accomplish or try. Purpose-built simulators are great, too, but they have their own limitations.\r\nMineDojo is a simulation framework built around Minecraft, since you can’t just plonk a random AI in there and expect it to understand what all these blocks and pigs are doing. Its creators (lots of overlap with the Voyager team) put together YouTube videos about the game, transcripts, wiki articles, and a whole lot of Reddit posts from r/minecraft, among other data, so users can create or fine-tune an AI model on them. It also lets those models be evaluated more or less objectively by seeing how well they do things like build a fence around a llama or find and mine a diamond.",

      "Antitrust is the engine of free enterprise: it shapes countless lines of commerce, from tech to toilets, beer to baseball, and healthcare to hardware. Antitrust drives price, quality, variety, innovation and opportunity.\r\nToday, artificial intelligence is rapidly changing how businesses sense, reason and adapt in the market. Across every industry, companies are leveraging machine learning to derive valuable insights without extensive employee involvement. But these groundbreaking capabilities are creating an upheaval in how companies engage with competitors and consumers.\r\nExperienced competition and consumer protection lawyers can help companies capitalize on the opportunities AI presents while navigating the terra nova of regulatory and litigation risk. Although it is incorrect to approach AI as a black box, the complexity of AI systems can make reasoning opaque. This means linkages between AI outputs and rational business justifications risk being obscured or even lost entirely.\r\nYet regulators are unlikely to excuse consumer and competitive concerns merely because an organization cannot explain why certain actions were taken and others were not. Legal exposure exists under the Sherman Antitrust Act, Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC), Robinson-Patman Act, as well as state antitrust and consumer protection laws. By implementing policies and processes that preserve human control and accountability, organizations can minimize legal exposure and avoid unintended consequences.",

    content:
      "On Monday, Apple is more than likely going to reveal its long-awaited augmented or mixed reality Reality Pro headset during the keynote of its annual WWDC developer conference in California. It’s an announcement that has been tipped or teased for years now, and reporting on the topic has suggested that at various times, the project has been subject to delays, internal skepticism and debate, technical challenges and more. Leaving anything within Apple’s sphere of influence aside, the world’s overall attitude toward AR and VR has shifted considerably — from optimism, to skepticism.\r\nPart of that trajectory is just the natural progression of any major tech hype cycle, and you could easily argue that the time to make the most significant impact in any such cycle is after the spike of undue optimism and energy has subsided. But in the case of AR and VR, we’ve actually already seen some of the tech giants with the deepest pockets take their best shots and come up wanting — not for lack of trying, but because of limitations in terms of what’s possible even at the bleeding edge of available tech. Some of those limits might actually be endemic to AR and VR, too, because of variances in the human side of the equation required to make mixed reality magic happen.\r\nThe virtual elephant in the room is, of course, Meta. The name itself pretty much sums up the situation: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg read a bad book and decided that VR was the inevitable end state of human endeavor — the mobile moment he essentially missed out on, but even bigger and better. Zuckerberg grew enamored by his delusion, first acquiring crowdfunded VR darling Oculus, then eventually commandeering the sobriquet for a shared virtual universe from the dystopian predictions of a better book and renaming all of Facebook after it.\r\nMeta has had its kick at the can — in fact it’s been kicking furiously for the past half-decade at least. The last two efforts of note were the Meta Quest 3, which it revealed earlier this week to mild applause, and the intensely overpriced Meta Quest Pro, which landed with a thud that was anything but virtual. The best that you can say for Mark’s metaversal ambitions is that the Meta Quest and Quest 2 lured in a decent number of VR-curious casuals — but not nearly enough to build a sustainable business on at the scale of Facebook or the iPhone.",

      "The world we used to live in the one that revolved around using cheap money to pump up ARR is gone.\r\nIt came to a screeching halt with rising interest rates, and it’s not on its way back anytime soon. VCs responded as VCs do: by quickly shifting from a “growth-at-all-costs” mindset to focusing on instant profitability while funding metrics shifted from just revenue and growth to including costs as well.Since the beginning of Q2, a spur of companies, including hardware companies, have come out of the gate and started raising money. The Silicon Valley Bank (and, more recently, Free Republic Bank) debacle has been relatively short-lived, but, given the multiple rollercoasters the industry has been on, one has got to wonder where the goal posts are nowadays.\r\nThere’s no debate that the SaaS game has changed, and yet a consensus on Series A funding metrics for these companies hasn’t emerged. However, it is not too difficult to guess that it would be roughly around double the revenue bar at the same or lower cost. It’s a challenging proposition, but a clear and tangible goal to strive for — and one that cannot be applied to hardware companies without revenue in their early stages.\r\nSo how can a hardware company raise a Series A amidst yet another “new normal” in this post-low-interest-rate era?",

    content:
      "Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i drew both appreciative and skeptical stares at CES earlier this year when it made its official debut: With two 13-inch OLED screens attached with a central hinge, it’s one of the most unusual laptop designs to ever make it into actual production. The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i ($2,099) is building on a long tradition of dual-screen notebook and portable device concepts (along with some shipping hardware), but it’s the first that proves the paradigm can work — and work well — for a lot of people.The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is defined by one feature in particular: Instead of having a hardware keyboard and trackpad for its lower half, it has a second 13.3-inch OLED screen to match the one on top. These are connected by a remarkable hinge that allows for use in a number of orientations, and which also packs in a speaker array powered by Bowers & Wilkins (more on this later, but spoiler: it works really well).\r\nIn the box, you also get a separate Bluetooth keyboard, a stylus (Lenovo’s Digital Pen 3), a Bluetooth mouse and an origami-style folding stand that also doubles as a case for the keyboard and stylus. The sticker price of $2,099 definitely can seem steep at first glance, but Lenovo has at least done right by customers by including everything they need in the box instead of making accessories like keyboard, stylus and mouse available piecemeal as add-on purchases after the fact.\r\nLuckily, aside from some questionable accessory colorway choices, Lenovo gets everything else pretty much exactly right. The upper and lower halves of the Yoga Book 9i close with a satisfying sticky click, and the hinge maintains them at whatever angle you choose to use them at. This is especially important because the Yoga Book 9i can be used in quite a few different ways, including a standard laptop orientation with or without the hardware keyboard magnetically attached to the bottom display; with the screen flipped all the way around in a single screen tablet mode; with the displays stacked on top of one another and propped up on the stand in a horizontal dual-screen mode; with the displays side-by-each in a vertical dual screen orientation; or with both screens active and facing two different users on either side in tent mode.",

So, what happens if you send Snapchats My AI bot nudes?\r\nThis is the obvious question that comes to mind, because on the internet, people will immediately try to test the limits of new technology, especially if it is even tangentially related to sex. When Snapchat’s initial GPT-powered chatbot came out this spring, it lacked appropriate age-gating features, so a reporter who registered on Snapchat as a 15-year-old was able to get the bot to give advice on how to cover up the smell of weed or set the mood for sex.When asked about those findings at the Snap Partner Summit in April, CEO Evan Spiegel said, “I think humans, whenever we come across new technology, the first thing we try to do is break it.”\r\nSo, naturally, I tried to break Snapchat’s new My AI Snaps.Though Snapchat added more guardrails to prevent the bot from having inappropriate conversations with teens, there’s still a lot riding on My AI Snaps. With the amount of controversy that Snap’s text AI stirred up, the company needed My AI Snaps to be as unbreakable as possible. Unfortunately, it’s barely coherent enough to break.As a very serious reporter, I made a very serious Google Images search: “boobs.” I found a generic picture of boobs, took a snap of my computer screen, and sent it to My AI.",
